/*
 String by reverse a string.
 - Problem is  many emoji characters are internally stored as a surrogate pair of 2 characters.
 - Apple document recommends using rangeOfComposedCharacterSequencesForRange: to avoid breaking up character sequences.
 - Using NSMutableString does the job nice and clean and I assume the input string might be large hence unfortunately NSMutableString would create a lot of unnecessary temporary objects.
 - I've found myself playing with UTF-32 buffer and the result is much faster. Oh you might notice that it only needs to loop through the first half.
